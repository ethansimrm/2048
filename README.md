# 2048

This is my basic re-creation of the game 2048 in the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science.

Due to the highly specific nature of the GUI, it only works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_iXZSzMsXYotyGVW_17.py

This game initialises a 4x4 board; use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
